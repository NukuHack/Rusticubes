# Project TODO  

## High Priority  
- [ ] slight ui rework (mainly just make the text not overflow)

## Low Priority  
- [ ] hardcode the "missing texture" texture (purple black or idk)
- [ ] 2d texture array and load in some other textures -> more blocks
- [ ] New UI element as Slider
- [ ] Some basic Rounding for UI elements
- [ ] Maybe a "multi-state" button kind of thing (like a slider but with a button)
- [ ] Making a new "panel" kind of thing with scrollable contents
