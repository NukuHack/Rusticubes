### 🚀 A Rusty Experiment 🦀  
A playful repo for learning Rust by building a game (no promises tho).

---

## 🛠️ What's Inside?  
- **Learning playground**: Small Rust projects to master concepts.  
- **Game prototype**: WIP experiments with movement, visuals, and sounds.  
- **Batch script**: `run.bat` for easy setup.

---

## 🔥 Quick Start Guide  

1. **Install Rust & Dependencies**  
   Run `run.bat` to set up Rust and required tools.  
   *Handles PATH configs and dependencies automatically.*  
   
   Use the same file to compile and launch your project with one click.  
   *If rust is correctly placed at your computer it will instantly run the file*  

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips  

- **"Batch file not recognized"**  
  Run files as Administrator when prompted.  

- **Installation issues**  
  Delete `.cargo` in `C:\Users\<YourName>` and run `run.bat`.  

- **Compiler errors**  
  Double-check that `run.bat` ran successfully.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Rust**: Chaos with memory safety.  
- **Game crates**: `wgpu`, `winit`, `log`, `cgmath`.  
- **Batch file**: Automation for life.
