### 🚀 A Rusty Experiment 🦀
A playful repository for learning Rust while attempting to build a game (no promises on completion, but let's see how far the rust spreads!).

---

## 🛠️ What's Inside?
- **Learning playground**: Small Rust projects to grasp concepts
- **Game prototype**: WIP (Work In Progress) game experiments
- **Batch file shortcuts**: `install.bat`, `run.bat`, and `tools.bat` for seamless setup (shoutout to those scripts!)

---

## 🚨 Current Status
> **🚧 Under construction**  
> This is a learning project. Expect bugs, half-finished features, and lots of experimentation.

---

## 🏗️ Roadmap
Here's what I'm aiming for (but no guarantees!):
1. **Phase 1**: Rust fundamentals (variables, ownership, macros)
2. **Phase 2**: Basic game mechanics (movement, collision)
3. **Phase 3**: Add some "corrosion" flair (visuals, sound effects?)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
### If you want to play along:
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NukuHack/rusTry.git
   ```
2. **Run the setup**:
   ```bash
   install.bat  # Installs Rust and dependencies
   tools.bat    # Optional: If prompted for additional tools
   ```
3. **Launch the experiment**:
   ```bash
   run.bat      # Compiles and runs the current project
   ```

## 🤔 Why "rusTry"?
- A pun on "Rust" + "Attempt"
- Embraces the messy, iterative process of learning
- Because every project starts as an experiment

### 🌟 Future Dreams

*Maybe one day this will be a playable game...*  

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Rust**: For the memory-safe, performant chaos
- **Game crates**: `wgpu`, `winit`, `log`, `cgmath` and others
- **Batch files**: Because automation is life
