### 🚀 A rusty Experiment 🦀  
A playful repo for learning Rust by building a game (no promises tho).

---

## 🛠️ What's Inside?  
- **Learning playground**: Small Rust projects to master concepts.  
- **Game prototype**: WIP experiments with movement, visuals, and sounds.  
- **Batch script**: `run.bat` for easy setup.
     (Somewhere around Alpha 0.4 Prerelease I added crates needing MSYS2 so without that you will not be able to compile and run the code)

---

## 🚨 Current Status  
> **🚧 Under construction**  
Bugs, unfinished features, and experimentation ahead.

---

## 📝 License

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **rust**: Chaos with memory safety.  
- **Game crates**: [`wgpu`](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu), [`winit`](https://crates.io/crates/winit), [`glam`](https://crates.io/crates/glam), [`image`](https://crates.io/crates/image).  
- **Batch file**: Automation for life.
